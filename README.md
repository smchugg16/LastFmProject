# ScrobblesProject/Some Background Information
This project uses the website/app Last.Fm, a tool used to count "scrobbles" or number of plays of a certain song/track.
This tool tracked my plays on spotify and apple music starting in April 12 2020 all the way through April 12 2023. 
The intention of this project is to determine what kinds of music I listen to the most, when I listen to music the most, and other trends within this data. 

# Methodology 
The data was ripped from my last.fm account using https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/.
Then, this data was cleaned using Microsoft Excel
