# Music Listening Habits Analysis

## Overview
This project utilizes Last.Fm, a platform that tracks music "scrobbles" (plays), to analyze my listening habits on Spotify and Apple Music over the period from April 12, 2020, to April 12, 2023. The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into my music preferences, discover patterns in when and what I listen to, and explore trends within the data.

## Methodology
Data Retrieval: Music listening data was collected from my Last.Fm account using lastfm-to-csv, a data extraction tool.

### Data Cleaning: Initial data cleaning and preparation were performed using Microsoft Excel and SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency.

### Table Creation: SQL was further utilized to organize and structure the dataset, resulting in a master dataset.

### Visualization: The dataset was imported into Tableau, a data visualization tool. Here, a variety of visualizations were created to showcase and interpret my listening habits.
