# Music Listening Habits Analysis

## Overview:
This project utilizes [Last.Fm]([last.fm](https://www.last.fm/)), a platform that tracks music "scrobbles" (plays), to analyze my listening habits on Spotify and Apple Music over the period from April 12, 2020, to October 12, 2024*. The primary goal of this project is to gain insights into my music preferences, discover patterns in when and what I listen to, and explore trends within the data.

## Methodology:

- Data Retrieval: [Music listening data]((https://github.com/smchugg16/LastFmProject/blob/main/New%20LastFm%20Data.xlsx)) was collected from my Last.Fm account using [lastfm-to-csv](https://benjaminbenben.com/lastfm-to-csv/), a data extraction tool.

- Data Cleaning: Initial data cleaning and preparation were performed using Microsoft Excel and SQL to ensure accuracy and consistency.

- Table Creation: SQL was further utilized to organize and structure the dataset, resulting in a master dataset. This also included tables for [Time of Day](https://github.com/smchugg16/LastFmProject/blob/main/TimeOfDay%20NEW.sql) a song was listened to, [How many times a Year a song was listened to](https://github.com/smchugg16/LastFmProject/blob/main/YearlyPlays.sql) and [others]((https://github.com/smchugg16/LastFmProject/blob/main/DatasetBuilding%20NEW.sql)).

- Visualization: The dataset was imported into Tableau, a data visualization tool. Here, a variety of visualizations were created to showcase and interpret my listening habits.
